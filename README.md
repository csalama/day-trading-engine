## Project 5

### Intro/Objective

The objective of this project is to build a reinforcement learning algorithm to trade an individual stock based on technical information.

### Description

I will be exploring a reinforcement algorithm in order to trade an individual stock based easily available on a fundamental price information.  The MVP goal for this project is to create an optimal strategy to maximize profit for an individual stock, and time permitting, I will expand this to a portfolio of stocks and possibly include a wider variety of data.  I will use Keras-RL as the main reinforcement learning library. 

### Status

- [x] Built dataset
- [x] Built and adjusted the environment
- [x] Built DQN model
- [x] Built time-series cross-val split
- [ ] Fixing minor bugs for initial run
- [ ] Build simple app
- [ ] Build a baselining strategy to compare against
- [ ] Iterate with larger dataset and portfolio
