## Project 5

### Intro/Objective

The objective of this project is to build a reinforcement learning algorithm to trade an individual stock based on technical information.

### Description

I will be exploring a reinforcement algorithm in order to trade an individual stock based on technical price information.  The initial goal for this project is to create a reforcement learning model to trade an individual stock.  I will use StableBaselines as the main reinforcement learning library and will implement an OpenAI Gym as the interface for the library.  

Various methods were tested, but the resulting method is shown in model_testing and implemented in stock_env.  The trained model is not included in the repo due to the large size, but can be constructed by building the dataset and using model_testing.  The results for the testing period are found in clean_testing_data.csv, and these results were used within the given presentation in reports.
